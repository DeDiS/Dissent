== Microbenchmarks == (over N, L, security parameter) 
* message size
* proof generate 
* proof verify
--> Compare with XOR
--> Show asymptotic performance (huge N, etc)

== Macrobenchmarks == (over % nodes sending)
* (chat-room) tweet-sized messages
* 1MB PDF, infrequent

== Scheduling ==
* change length of slots
* dynamic slot opening and closing
(using DC-net XOR with single bit)

== Accountability ==
* time to first byte over # of attackers
